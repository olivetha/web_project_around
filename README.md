## Overview

Welcome to the "US Around" project, the sixth stage of the Triple Ten Web Development bootcamp. On this interactive web page, users can add, remove, and like photos of the most breathtaking landscapes in the United States. This project served as a platform to apply the newly acquired knowledge of JavaScript and DOM manipulation, gained during this exciting sixth sprint.

## Project Highlights

- **JavaScript and DOM Manipulation:** We harnessed the power of JavaScript to create dynamic features that allow users to add, remove, and like photos. All of these actions are seamlessly integrated into the Document Object Model (DOM), resulting in a highly interactive and immersive user experience.

- **Responsiveness:** We prioritized responsiveness to ensure that our page is accessible on various devices, including mobile. By using specific media queries tailored to different screen sizes, we set maximum heights and defined widths in percentages, delivering a seamless user experience across diverse devices.

- **Grid Layout:** Our adoption of the "grid" layout system enabled us to effectively structure and organize page elements, ensuring an aesthetically pleasing and well-organized design.

- **CSS Styling:** We invested significant effort in styling, customizing links, background sections, and fonts. This attention to detail results in an attractive and cohesive design, providing an engaging visual experience.

- **Profile Edit Popup:** We implemented JavaScript variables and functions to create a profile edit popup, empowering users to interactively edit their profiles.

- **New Photo Addition Popup:** We implemented JavaScript variables and functions to create a popup for adding new photos to the profile, allowing users to edit their content interactively.

- **Photo zoom Popup:** We implemented JavaScript variables and functions to create a popup for expanding the photos added to the profile, enhancing the page's interactivity.
